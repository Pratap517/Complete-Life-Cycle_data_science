reducing avoidable bias

Increase the model size

Modify input features based on insights from error analysis

Reduce or eliminate regularization (L2 regularization, L1 regularization, dropout):  reduce avoidable bias, but increase variance.

Modify model architecture: so that it is more suitable for your problem


reducing variance


Add more training data

Add regularization (L2 regularization, L1 regularization, dropout): This technique reduces variance but increases bias.

Add early stopping

Feature selection to decrease number/type of input features

Decrease the model size

Modify model architecture: so that it is more suitable for your problem
